# pathmap

This crate provides a key-value store with prefix compression, structural sharing, and powerful algebraic operations.

PathMap is optimized for large data sets under write-heavy workloads, and can be used efficiently in a multi-threaded environment.

This crate provides the low-level data structure for [MORK](https://github.com/trueagi-io/MORK/)

## This fork

On top of the crate above, this fork adds memory-safety
hardening (the unsafe paths cleared under Miri, the sanitizers, and Kani), additional zipper
algebra, and performance tooling. It is the low-level substrate for the optimized
[MORK fork](https://github.com/MesTTo/MORK), where the end-to-end speedups are measured: a
worst-case-optimal join roughly a thousand times faster on clique detection, and parallel point
queries past 17 million per second.

## Why pathmap?

Several crates implement radix-256 trie structures in Rust.  For example [radix_trie](https://crates.io/crates/radix_trie) does it without any unsafe code.  Pathmap is unique because of the following combination of features:

* Pathmap is a DAG, not just a trie.  See the [subtrie sharing](https://pathmap-rs.github.io/#structural-sharing) section in the book.
* A safe and sound concurrent API for reading and writing
* Algebraic operations such as `join`, `meet`, etc. and the ability to apply them to subtries as well as whole maps
* A *lot* of work has gone into making the implementation fast, keeping the memory footprint small, and designing the API to expose the lowest overhead paths.
* The ACT format enables tries that don't fit in memory

## Usage

Check out the [book](https://pathmap-rs.github.io/).

## kvmap

The crate name **`pathmap`** was previously used by **Canmi** for a different project, 
[`kvmap`](https://github.com/canmi21/kvmap) *(formerly published as `pathmap`)*, 
which is a SQL-driven key-value store.  If you are looking for Canmi’s SQL-based KVMap project, please visit:  
[https://github.com/canmi21/kvmap](https://github.com/canmi21/kvmap)

## Getting Started

Add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
pathmap = "0.2"
```

**NOTE** This is pre-release software and there is going to be further API churn.  We will try to respect semver, but you may want to specify an exact version to be insulated from the churn.

## Optional Cargo features

- `nightly`: Uses nightly-only features including support for a custom [`Allocator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html), better SIMD optimizations, etc.  Requires the *nightly* tool-chain.

- `arena_compact`: Exposes an additional read-only trie format and read-zipper type that is more efficient in memory and supports mapping a large file from disk.

- `jemalloc`: Enables [jemalloc](https://jemalloc.net/) as the default allocator.  This dramatically improves scaling for write-heavy workloads and is generally recommended.  The only reason it is not the default is to avoid interference with the host application's allocator.

- `zipper_tracking`: Exports the `zipper_tracking` module publicly, allowing the host application to use the conflict-checking logic independently of zipper creation.

- `viz`: Provide APIs to inspect and visualize pathmap trie structures.  Useful to observe structural sharing.

Other cargo features in this crate are intended for use by the developers of `pathmap` itself.
